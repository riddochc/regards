  # In current versions of ruby (2.3), respond_to? doesn't return true for methods defined using refinements.
  # As a workaround, I'm introducing this refined_with? method to test whether the method is in a list of known refinement methods.
  # Unfortunately, attempting to modify the class with a constant listing methods refining it is currently not possible
  # from within the refine Klass { ... } block, so this adds the class#method to a global ::REFININGS hash for lookup.
